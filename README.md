## Nutrient Deficiency Classification
## Problem Statement
The objective of this task is to develop a machine learning pipeline using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to accurately classify coconut leaves based on nutrient deficiencies such as nitrogen, potassium, magnesium, and zinc. By leveraging image analysis and deep learning techniques, the model aims to provide an automated solution for nutrient deficiency detection and classification in coconut plants, specifically tailored for the agriculture industry in Sri Lanka.

Through this project, we aim to create a practical tool for coconut farmers in Sri Lanka, empowering them to identify and address nutrient deficiencies in coconut plants effectively. By leveraging the power of CNNs and machine learning, we strive to enhance nutritional management practices and optimize the growth and productivity of coconut plantations.

## Data Collection
The dataset consists of images of coconut leaves captured in coconut plantations across different regions in Sri Lanka. The data collection process involved capturing images of coconut leaves representing different classes based on nutrient deficiency:

Healthy Leaves: Images of coconut leaves in a healthy state, without any signs of nutrient deficiency.

Nitrogen Deficiency: Nitrogen deficiency in coconut leaves is recognizable by the yellowing of older leaves and stunted growth. These visual cues serve as important indicators of the nutrient imbalance affecting the coconut plants

Potassium Deficiency: Images of coconut leaves with potassium deficiency symptoms, such as yellowing or browning of leaf margins and interveinal chlorosis.

Magnesium Deficiency: Images of coconut leaves displaying magnesium deficiency symptoms, such as yellowing between leaf veins and leaf curling.

The objective of this project was to develop a machine learning pipeline using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models to accurately classify coconut leaves affected by different nutrient deficiencies. The project aimed to provide an automated solution for detecting and classifying nutrient deficiencies in coconut plants, specifically tailored for the agriculture industry.

The dataset used in this project was collected in collaboration with agricultural experts and farmers, ensuring its relevance and applicability to the local context. The dataset consisted of images of coconut leaves representing different classes, including magnesium deficiency, nitrogen deficiency, potassium deficiency, and healthy leaves.

Three CNN models, namely EfficientNet, DenseNet121, and VGG-16, were implemented and trained on the dataset. The models were evaluated based on their accuracy in classifying the nutrient deficiencies in coconut leaves.

According to the evaluation results, the EfficientNet model achieved the highest accuracy of 0.9058, indicating its effectiveness in classifying nutrient deficiencies in coconut leaves. The DenseNet121 model followed with an accuracy of 0.8393, while the VGG-16 model performed relatively poorly with an accuracy of 0.2078.

The high accuracy achieved by the EfficientNet model demonstrates its potential as a practical tool for coconut farmers to detect and address nutrient deficiencies in their plants. By accurately identifying the specific nutrient deficiencies, farmers can take appropriate measures to improve the health and yield of their coconut trees.

It is important to note that further validation and testing, such as cross-validation or using an independent dataset, would be beneficial to ensure the robustness and generalizability of the models.

In conclusion, this project successfully developed a machine learning pipeline using CNN models to classify nutrient deficiencies in coconut leaves. It provides coconut farmers with a valuable tool to enhance their nutritional management practices, thereby supporting the growth and sustainability of the coconut industry.
